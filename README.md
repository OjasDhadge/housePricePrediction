# housePricePrediction
A full-stack machine learning project that predicts house prices based on input features using a Linear Regression model. The project includes:

📊 A trained regression model built with scikit-learn

🔙 A Flask backend to serve predictions via an API

🌐 A simple frontend interface for user interaction

The model was trained using relevant housing data and saved as a .pkl file. Users can input features like the number of rooms, area, location, etc., through the web interface, and get real-time price predictions powered by the backend API.
